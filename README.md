# BanksAgainstBitcoin
## A blacklist of banks that block/limit movements to or from Bitcoin/Crypto related services. ##

In this blacklist you can find and report banks that are blocking or limiting transactions to / from Bitcoin or Crypto related services.
<br>If you experienced such behavior from your bank, please open a PR or an Issue.

**What we need:**
1. Name of the bank
2. SWIFT/BIC
3. A clear proof (an email, a pdf, a link to their policies...anything)

We will try to make a distinction between total block/ban and limits.
